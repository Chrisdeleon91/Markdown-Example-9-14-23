**but there is a paragraph break** *here*

> "Who are you? What's your background?"

`I am an overall tech geek, I first was introduced to electronics through building PCs then working closing with the electrical world as an electrician.
I went to New York Institute of Technology for both a bachelors and masters degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I also did a math minor during my bachelors degree.
I worked as design management engineer at the MTA, then worked on analog and digital hardware specific job in two defense related jobs. I quickly gained the experience through
work to code FPGAs.` 

> "What are your career goals?"

`I now want to integrate high-frequency trading algorithms into FPGA (hardware). I will need to polish up my C/C++ to ultimately do so, but I feel confident I will be a desirable candidate
in a HFT firm.` 

> "Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?"

`I want to integrate all of my interests into one job, FPGAs, algorithms and making money!`
